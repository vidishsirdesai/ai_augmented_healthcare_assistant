    {"condition": "Type 2 Diabetes", "guide": "Initial management involves comprehensive lifestyle changes (dietary modifications, regular physical activity, weight management). If HbA1c remains elevated (typically >6.5-7.0%), Metformin is the recommended first-line pharmacological agent, unless contraindicated. Other oral agents or injectable therapies (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLM2 inhibitors) may be added or substituted based on individual patient factors, comorbidities, and glycemic targets. Insulin therapy is indicated for severe hyperglycemia, significant weight loss, or inadequate response to oral agents. Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, renal function, and lipid profile is crucial. Comprehensive foot exams annually are essential for early detection of diabetic neuropathy and foot ulcers. Patient education on self-management is paramount."},
    {"condition": "Hypertension", "guide": "Management of hypertension begins with lifestyle modifications including the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan, reduced sodium intake (<2300 mg/day, ideally <1500 mg/day), regular aerobic exercise (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity per week), moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss for overweight/obese individuals. First-line pharmacological agents include ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), Thiazide diuretics, and Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs). The choice of agent depends on patient comorbidities, age, and individual response. Target blood pressure is generally <130/80 mmHg for most adults. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary."},
    {"condition": "Migraine", "guide": "Acute migraine treatment involves simple analgesics (NSAIDs) for mild-to-moderate attacks. Triptans (e.g., Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan) are specific serotonin receptor agonists effective for moderate-to-severe attacks. CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) and serotonin 1F agonists (ditans) are newer acute options. Prophylactic treatment is considered for frequent or debilitating migraines (e.g., >4 headache days/month). Prophylactic agents include beta-blockers (Propranolol, Timolol), tricyclic antidepressants (Amitriptyline), anticonvulsants (Topiramate, Valproate), and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Lifestyle management, stress reduction, and trigger avoidance are also important."},
    {"condition": "Osteoarthritis", "guide": "Non-pharmacological management includes patient education, exercise (aerobic and strengthening), weight management, and physical therapy. Pharmacological options for pain relief include topical NSAIDs, oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and duloxetine. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief. Hyaluronic acid injections are also an option. Surgical interventions like arthroscopy or total joint replacement are considered for severe, refractory cases. Lifestyle adjustments to reduce joint stress are crucial."},
    {"condition": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder", "guide": "Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. First-line pharmacological agents include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like Escitalopram and Sertraline, and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) like Venlafaxine and Duloxetine. Benzodiazepines may be used for short-term relief of severe anxiety, but long-term use is generally discouraged due to dependence risk. Lifestyle interventions such as regular exercise, mindfulness, stress management techniques, and adequate sleep are also beneficial."}
