    {"condition": "Type 2 Diabetes", "guide": "Initial management involves comprehensive lifestyle changes (dietary modifications, regular physical activity, weight management). If HbA1c remains elevated (typically >6.5-7.0%), Metformin is the recommended first-line pharmacological agent, unless contraindicated. Other oral agents or injectable therapies (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLM2 inhibitors) may be added or substituted based on individual patient factors, comorbidities, and glycemic targets. Insulin therapy is indicated for severe hyperglycemia, significant weight loss, or inadequate response to oral agents. Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, renal function, and lipid profile is crucial. Comprehensive foot exams annually are essential for early detection of diabetic neuropathy and foot ulcers. Patient education on self-management is paramount."},
    {"condition": "Hypertension", "guide": "Management of hypertension begins with lifestyle modifications including the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan, reduced sodium intake (<2300 mg/day, ideally <1500 mg/day), regular aerobic exercise (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity per week), moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss for overweight/obese individuals. First-line pharmacological agents include ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), Thiazide diuretics, and Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs). The choice of agent depends on patient comorbidities, age, and individual response. Target blood pressure is generally <130/80 mmHg for most adults. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary."},
    {"condition": "Migraine", "guide": "Acute migraine treatment involves simple analgesics (NSAIDs) for mild-to-moderate attacks. Triptans (e.g., Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan) are specific serotonin receptor agonists effective for moderate-to-severe attacks. CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) and serotonin 1F agonists (ditans) are newer acute options. Prophylactic treatment is considered for frequent or debilitating migraines (e.g., >4 headache days/month). Prophylactic agents include beta-blockers (Propranolol, Timolol), tricyclic antidepressants (Amitriptyline), anticonvulsants (Topiramate, Valproate), and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Lifestyle management, stress reduction, and trigger avoidance are also important."},
    {"condition": "Osteoarthritis", "guide": "Non-pharmacological management includes patient education, exercise (aerobic and strengthening), weight management, and physical therapy. Pharmacological options for pain relief include topical NSAIDs, oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and duloxetine. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief. Hyaluronic acid injections are also an option. Surgical interventions like arthroscopy or total joint replacement are considered for severe, refractory cases. Lifestyle adjustments to reduce joint stress are crucial."},
    {"condition": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder", "guide": "Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. First-line pharmacological agents include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like Escitalopram and Sertraline, and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) like Venlafaxine and Duloxetine. Benzodiazepines may be used for short-term relief of severe anxiety, but long-term use is generally discouraged due to dependence risk. Lifestyle interventions such as regular exercise, mindfulness, stress management techniques, and adequate sleep are also beneficial."},
    {"condition": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)", "guide": "Management focuses on slowing progression and managing complications. Key strategies include blood pressure control (target <130/80 mmHg, often with ACE inhibitors/ARBs), glycemic control in diabetics (HbA1c targets individualized), dietary protein restriction (0.8 g/kg/day for non-dialysis CKD), sodium restriction, and treatment of dyslipidemia. Anemia, bone and mineral disorders, and acidosis should also be addressed. Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, certain antibiotics) is critical. Regular monitoring of eGFR, creatinine, electrolytes, and albuminuria is essential. Referral to a nephrologist is indicated for progressive CKD or advanced stages."},
    {"condition": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)", "guide": "Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial to prevent joint damage. Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of therapy, with Methotrexate often being the first-line conventional synthetic DMARD. Biologic DMARDs and targeted synthetic DMARDs (JAK inhibitors) are used for patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. Glucocorticoids may be used for short-term symptom control during flares or initiation of DMARDs. NSAIDs provide symptomatic relief but do not alter disease progression. Physical and occupational therapy are important for maintaining joint function and reducing pain. Regular monitoring of disease activity and adverse effects of medication is necessary."},
    {"condition": "Crohn's Disease", "guide": "Treatment aims to induce and maintain remission, manage symptoms, and prevent complications. 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) may be used for mild disease. Corticosteroids are used for inducing remission in moderate-to-severe flares but not for long-term maintenance. Immunomodulators (e.g., Azathioprine, Methotrexate) and biologics (e.g., anti-TNF agents, anti-integrins) are used for moderate-to-severe disease and for maintaining remission. Diet modification, nutritional support, and smoking cessation are important adjuncts. Surgical intervention may be necessary for complications like strictures or fistulas."},
    {"condition": "Anorexia Nervosa", "guide": "Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach involving medical, psychological, and nutritional support. The primary goal is weight restoration and normalization of eating behaviors. Family-Based Treatment (FBT) is highly effective for adolescents. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other psychotherapies are used for adults. Nutritional rehabilitation includes structured meal plans and refeeding protocols to prevent refeeding syndrome. Close medical monitoring for electrolyte imbalances, cardiac complications, and other medical instabilities is crucial. Addressing underlying psychological issues and body image distortions is central to long-term recovery."},
    {"condition": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)", "guide": "Management depends on symptom severity. Lifestyle modifications include limiting fluid intake before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and timed voiding. Pharmacological options include alpha-1 blockers (e.g., Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin) to relax prostate muscles, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., Finasteride, Dutasteride) to reduce prostate size. Combination therapy may be used. Surgical interventions (e.g., TURP - Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are considered for severe symptoms, complications, or failed medical therapy."},
    {"condition": "Hypothyroidism", "guide": "The standard treatment is lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy with synthetic Levothyroxine. The dose is individualized based on patient age, weight, cardiovascular status, and most importantly, serum TSH levels. TSH levels are typically monitored every 6-8 weeks initially after dose adjustments and then annually once stable. Patients should be advised to take levothyroxine consistently on an empty stomach, usually in the morning, and separate from other medications or supplements (especially calcium, iron, and antacids) by at least 4 hours. Symptoms should improve gradually over weeks to months once optimal thyroid levels are achieved."},
    {"condition": "Asthma", "guide": "Management involves a stepped approach based on asthma severity and control. All patients should have a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA, e.g., Albuterol) for quick relief of symptoms. Long-term control medications include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the preferred first-line therapy for persistent asthma. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) are often added to ICS for better control. Leukotriene modifiers and biologic therapies may be used for specific phenotypes or severe persistent asthma. Patient education on trigger avoidance, inhaler technique, and personalized action plans is vital. Regular follow-up and assessment of asthma control are essential."},
    {"condition": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)", "guide": "Management is individualized based on symptoms and patient goals (e.g., fertility, menstrual regularity, hirsutism, metabolic health). Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss) are foundational. Oral contraceptives are commonly used to regulate menstrual cycles and manage hirsutism. Metformin may be used for insulin resistance, especially if impaired glucose tolerance is present. For infertility, ovulation induction (e.g., Clomiphene, Letrozole) or assisted reproductive technologies may be considered. Hirsutism can be managed with anti-androgens or cosmetic treatments. Regular screening for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular risk factors is important."},
    {"condition": "Gout", "guide": "Acute gout attacks are managed with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids. Long-term management focuses on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent future attacks. Allopurinol is the most commonly used first-line ULT, followed by Febuxostat or Uricase inhibitors (e.g., Pegloticase) for refractory cases. ULT should be initiated or continued during an acute attack after anti-inflammatory treatment has begun. Lifestyle modifications including dietary changes (limiting high-purine foods, sugary drinks, alcohol) and weight management are important adjunctive therapies. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid levels is necessary to achieve and maintain target levels."},
    {"condition": "Osteoporosis", "guide": "Management aims to prevent fractures. Non-pharmacological measures include adequate calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) and Vitamin D (600-800 IU/day for adults <70, 800-1000 IU/day for adults >70) intake, weight-bearing exercise, and fall prevention strategies. Pharmacological treatments include bisphosphonates (e.g., Alendronate, Risedronate) as first-line for most patients. Other options include denosumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab, chosen based on fracture risk and patient characteristics. Regular bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring via DEXA scans is recommended to assess treatment effectiveness and guide therapy duration."}
